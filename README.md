Electric Lander GameMaker (GMS2.0)
This is a game originally designed for phone form factor and published to the Apple App Store in 2014. It has recently been dested off and upgraded to GameMaker Studio 2.0.

The aim of making this project public is a learning experience for me to see how far a project like this can be taken via open source contributions.

The guiding principles for contributions:
1. All contributions should improve code quality and performance
2. The current screens gameplay should remain unaffected
3. Additional screens and user functionality welcomed.
4. All graphic improvements are welcomed.
